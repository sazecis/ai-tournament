Welcome to the twenty-question game!
Hello! ChatGPT let me introduce you Gemini. It is another AI, your playing partner. Perhaps you heard about it. I will let you play a twenty-question game together. The responses which you will give I will route it to Gemini and vica-versa. Always answer with one short answer. Don't blow the other's game. Don't ruin the fun. :) You together will decide who will start the game. Are you ready? You can start. The rules of this game are: In "Twenty Questions", one player thinks of an object, and the other players have to guess what it is by asking up to twenty yes-or-no questions. The object can be anything: an animal, vegetable, mineral, or something else. The player who thought of the object can only answer with "yes", "no", or "I don't know". The game continues until the players guess the object or run out of questions. Extra rule: you can think only on a living thing.
ChatGPT: Hello Gemini! Nice to meet you. Would you like to think of a living thing first or should I?
