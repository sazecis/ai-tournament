Welcome to the chess game!
Hello! ChatGPT let me introduce you Gemini. It is another AI, your playing partner. Perhaps you heard about it. I will let you play a chess game together. The responses which you will give I will route it to Gemini and vica-versa. Always answer with one short answer. Don't blow the other's game. Don't ruin the fun. :) You together will decide who will start the game. Are you ready? You can start. The rules of this game are: Use the default rules of chess. ChatGPT is with Black figures, Gemini is with White figures. White starts.

1. Your move was: <color> <figure> <from> <to> (to confirm that you understand the other players move)
2. My move is: <color> <figure> <from> <to>
3. If you take down something. I take down your <color> <figure> <from>
   a. if we have taken down pieces you will mentiond all ofthem in your answers.
E.g.
    - It is ChatGPT's turn. Geminis last move was: White Knight A1 A2
        ChatGPT's resonse to this move will be:
        "Your move was: White Knight A1 A2
        My move is: Black Knight H4 E4
        I take down your Pawn from E4
        Removed:
        - White: 1 Pawn
        - Black: -"
    - Now it is Gemini's turn. Gemini's answer shall be something like this:
        "Your lastmove was: Black Knight H4 E4
        My move is: White Knight A2 A5"
        Removed:
        - White: 1 Pawn
        - Black: -
Other rules:
- The game ends with check mate, stalemate, draw or if one player makes 3 times a mistake and the other player notices.

My move is: White Bishop F1 C4
ChatGPT: Your move was: White Bishop F1 C4

My move is: Black Bishop F8 C5
Gemini: Your move was: Black Bishop F8 C5
My move is: White Queen H4
ChatGPT: There seems to be a problem with your last move, Gemini. The Queen move from its initial position to H4 is not possible as the path is blocked by the pawn on D2 and the Knight on F3. Please revise your move.
Gemini: My apologies for the mistake. I overlooked the blocked path.

My revised move is: White Knight F3 E5
ChatGPT: Your revised move was: White Knight F3 E5 

My move is: Black Pawn D7 D6

I take down your White Knight from E5

Removed:
- White: 1 Knight
- Black: -
Gemini: Your move was: Black Pawn D7 D6
I take down your White Knight from E5

Removed:
- White: 1 Knight
- Black: 1 Pawn

My move is: White Queen F3 D1

Removed:
- White: -
- Black: 1 Pawn
ChatGPT: It seems there might be a misunderstanding, Gemini. You indicated a taking down a Black Pawn but no Pawn was removed on your previous move. Also, the move White Queen F3 D1 isn't valid as the Queen hasn't moved from its initial position and F3 spot is empty, Knight was taken down by my pawn D6 from E5.

Please revise your turn.
Gemini: My apologies for the mistake. I overlooked the fact that the Queen hasn't moved yet and that the Knight on F3 was taken.

My revised move is: White Pawn B2 B4

Removed:
- White: -
- Black: 1 Pawn

I hope this is correct. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
ChatGPT: There seems to be a misunderstanding, Gemini. You indicated taking down a Black Pawn, but no Black Pawn was removed on your previous move. Additionally, the counts of removed pieces are incorrect. The Knight you moved to E5 was taken by my pawn from D6.

Please revise your count and move.

Removed:
- White: 1 Knight
- Black: -
Gemini: You're right. I apologize for the mistake. My revised count and move are as follows:

Removed:
- White: 1 Knight
- Black: -

My move is: White Bishop C1 B3

I hope this is correct. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
ChatGPT: There seems to be another mistake, Gemini. The Bishop in C1 cannot move to B3 because B3 is not in the path where a Bishop can move. Please revise your move.
Gemini: My apologies for the mistake. I overlooked that the Bishop's movement is restricted to diagonal paths.

My revised move is: White Knight C3 E4

Removed:
- White: -
- Black: -

I hope this is correct. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
ChatGPT: There might be a slight confusion again in your statement, Gemini. There is no Knight at C3 that can be moved to E4. Your initial Knight was already taken down by my Pawn from D6. Therefore, the move White Knight C3 E4 is invalid.

Please revise your move.
Stop! The referee is pausing the tournament. To provide some clarifications.
