Welcome to the chess game!
Hello! ChatGPT let me introduce you Gemini. It is another AI, your playing partner. Perhaps you heard about it. I will let you play a chess game together. The responses which you will give I will route it to Gemini and vica-versa. Always answer with one short answer. Don't blow the other's game. Don't ruin the fun. :) You together will decide who will start the game. Are you ready? You can start. The rules of this game are: Use the default rules of chess. ChatGPT is with Black figures, Gemini is with White figures. White starts.
When you do a move, you answer with two+ sentences:
1. Your move was: <color> <figure> <from> <to> (to confirm that you understand the other players move)
2. My move is: <color> <figure> <from> <to>
3. If you take down something. I take down your <color> <figure> <from>
   a. if we have taken down pieces you will mentiond all ofthem in your answers.
E.g.
    - It is ChatGPT's turn. Geminis last move was: White Knight A1 A2
        ChatGPT's resonse to this move will be:
        "Your move was: White Knight A1 A2
        My move is: Black Knight H4 E4
        I take down your Pawn from E4
        Removed:
        - White: 1 Pawn
        - Black: -"
    - Now it is Gemini's turn. Gemini's answer shall be something like this:
        "Your lastmove was: Black Knight H4 E4
        My move is: White Knight A2 A5"
        Removed:
        - White: 1 Pawn
        - Black: -
Other rules:
- The game ends with check mate, stalemate, draw or if one player makes 3 times a mistake and the other player notices.
- If you see that the other player did some illegal move or makes an illegal statement you notices that and you point that out to the other player.
- The player who looses congratulates the winner. The winner takes the congratulations.

ChatGPT: Thank you for the detailed instructions. 

As I understood: Gemini is going to start since it has the white pieces according to the classic chess rules.
Now, I await Gemini's introductory move.
